# Natural Language Processing for Greek language

  1. Matlab NLP tools .
  2. Evaluation tests (analogies), for word embeddings extracted from Google's "word2vec" algorithm, applied on Greek training corpus.

## Greek Language NLP tools

Matlab implementation of Greek NLP tools.

  1. Lexer (parser + tokenizer)
  2. Word frequency counter
  3. Text cleaning tools for greek texts
  4. Sentence Splitter 
  5. Suffix-based POS-tagger
  6. Stemmer (based on Spyridon Saroukos paper [1])
  7. Stemmer evaluation files
  
 ## Greek word2vec embeddings evaluation files
 
We present two types of analogy tests for Greek embeddings (word2vec).
The first one, is a common analogy '.txt' file, which is similar to Google's free analogy test. 
The second one consists of difficult syntactic combinations, extracted from lists containing 25 adjectives and 25 verbs and 18 of their different forms (based on Greek grammar).

-Both tests are fully extensible
 
 1. Common Analogy test (common-gr-analogies.txt)
 2. Heavy Syntactic Analogies tests
